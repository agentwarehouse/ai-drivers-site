# Offer: AI Drivers (V2)

## The Headline (Single-Sentence Offer)

**We build you a fully automated AI system team in less than 5 days. Custom-trained on your business, installed and running, with 6 months of direct founder access. $5,000.**

Alternative headlines (for testing):
- "Get a custom AI system team built, installed, and running inside your business in under 5 days. Two founders. Six months of support. One flat investment."
- "We replace your need to hire with a custom AI system built on your business in 5 days. Direct access to both founders for 6 months. ROI back within 90 days."
- "Your business. Our AI system. Installed in 5 days. Supported for 6 months. Paid for within 90 days."

---

## Offer Classification

- **Type:** Demand Generation (nobody is searching for "custom AI system team." We sell the concept first: that a properly built AI system replaces the need to hire. Then we sell our implementation.)
- **Delivery Model:** Hybrid (DFY system build + DWY coaching + ongoing support)
- **Logistical Intensity Level:** High (we assess the business, build the system, install it, train their agents on their specific data, troubleshoot when things break, and provide 6 months of direct access to both founders. Client participates in assessment and uses the system.)

---

## The Promise (Transformation)

- **Before State:** You're running your business and doing everything yourself, or paying people to do things that should be automated. You've heard about AI but every time you try to implement it, you end up with a glorified chatbot that doesn't understand your business. You're either stuck at your current revenue ceiling because you can't take on more work, or you're burning cash on contractors and employees for tasks that a properly trained system could handle. Meanwhile, you watch solo operators on Twitter running businesses that used to require 10-person teams.

- **After State:** You have a fully automated AI system team built specifically for your business. Your agents are trained on your processes, your data, your voice. They handle the work you used to hire for. You operate as a one-person business (or close to it) with the output of a full team. Your investment paid for itself within 90 days. And both founders are a message away for the next 6 months whenever you need help, adjustments, or new builds.

- **Timeframe:** System built and installed in less than 5 days. ROI back within 90 days. Founder access for 6 months.
- **Mechanism:** Full business assessment to identify highest-impact automation points, then custom AI system build trained on YOUR specific business, installed done-for-you, with 6 months of direct coaching and support from both founders (Kabrin + Elijah).

## The Founders

This is not a faceless course company. Two founders. Both operators. Both accessible.

### Kabrin Johal

Opened and operated 11 Orange Theory Fitness franchise locations. Exited in 2020. Went online: started with dropshipping, scaled to high-ticket dropshipping (sold that operation to a Las Vegas hotel chain), then launched his own agency in April 2024. $3M+ in total revenue generated across marketing, sales, and operations systems. All of it fulfilled through AI. The system you're getting is the system he uses to run his business every day.

### Elijah Bricker (21)

Skipped college. Started as a commercial realtor. Created Arbory LLC in 2025 and generated $1M in revenue for business owners in 14 months. Went all-in on systems automation using Claude Code and OpenClaw. His business now runs closed-loop automated. If there's a way to make a system do the work instead of a person, he's already built it.

**What makes these two different from everyone else teaching AI:**
They don't teach AI theory. They run businesses on AI. The system you're buying is the system powering their companies right now. Every agent, every workflow, every automation. In production. Generating revenue. Today.

---

## Who This Is For

- **Business owners doing $10K-$500K+/month** who are hitting a ceiling because they can't scale without hiring more people
- **Agency owners** (marketing, design, dev, consulting) who want 3-5x the output without 3-5x the team
- **Solo operators and freelancers** who know their craft but need infrastructure to multiply what one person can produce
- **Founders who tried AI and got underwhelmed.** You've used ChatGPT. You've tested a few tools. You know it should be doing more. You just need someone to build a real system, not hand you another prompt list.
- **People who value speed.** You don't want to spend 6 months learning. You want a system built, installed, and working inside your business within a week.

---

## Who This Is NOT For

- **People who want passive income or a "set it and forget it" button.** This is an operating system. You still run your business. The AI handles the execution. You direct it.
- **People without a business or clear business idea.** We build AI systems for existing operations. You need something to automate.
- **People who are not willing to invest in the tools.** The system runs on Claude. That's a separate cost (~$20-100/month depending on your plan). We build on it. You maintain the subscription.
- **People expecting magic.** The system is powerful. It produces real output and real ROI. But it requires a real business with real workflows to automate. If you don't have that, this isn't for you yet.
- **People who just want prompts.** This is a custom-built, multi-agent system with trained skills, automation hooks, and quality control. If you're looking for a list of ChatGPT prompts, that's a different product entirely.

## The Guarantee

**90-Day ROI Guarantee:** If you go through the full implementation process, use the system as directed, and don't make your $5,000 investment back within 90 days, we continue building, optimizing, and supporting until you do.

This is not a "hope it works" situation. Both founders use these exact systems to run their own businesses. Kabrin has generated $3M+ through systems like these. Elijah generated $1M in revenue for clients in 14 months. The system works. The variable is applying it to your specific business, which is exactly what the assessment, custom build, and 6 months of founder access covers.

### Stipulations

**State Stipulations (what you must already have):**
1. An active business or agency with existing workflows and revenue (the system needs real operations to automate)
2. A Claude Pro or Claude Team subscription (the system runs on Claude infrastructure)
3. A computer capable of running Claude Code (we help with setup if needed)

**Action Stipulations (what you must do):**
4. Complete the business assessment process fully and honestly (we need accurate information to build the right system)
5. Dedicate a minimum of 3 hours per week to learning and using the system during the first 90 days
6. Attend at least 75% of the weekly coaching calls during the first 90 days
7. Implement the system into at least 2 active business workflows within the first 30 days
8. Respond to founder messages within 48 hours during the implementation phase (so we can troubleshoot and iterate quickly)

### Refund Structure

No refunds for non-participation. The guarantee activates only when all stipulations are met. If you complete every stipulation and the system demonstrably fails to generate $5,000+ in value (through time saved, revenue generated, or costs reduced) within 90 days, we extend all support at no additional cost until it does.

We are not worried about this guarantee. The math is simple: if the system saves you 10 hours per week and your time is worth $50/hour, that's $2,000/month in recovered capacity. Three months = $6,000. Your investment is covered by time savings alone, before counting new revenue the system helps generate.

## Pricing

### Investment
- **Full Payment:** $5,000
- **Payment Plan:** 2 x $2,650 (30 days apart)

### ROI Math

"Your $5,000 investment needs to produce $5,000 in value within 90 days. Here's what that actually looks like:

**Path 1: Time saved.** If the system saves you 10 hours per week (conservative for a fully automated AI team), and your time is worth $50/hour, that's $2,000/month. In 90 days, you've recovered $6,000. Investment paid.

**Path 2: Revenue generated.** If you use the freed-up capacity to take on ONE additional client at $5,000, you've covered the entire investment from a single deal.

**Path 3: Costs reduced.** If the system replaces even one contractor you're currently paying $1,500-$2,000/month, you break even in under 3 months.

Most clients hit all three paths simultaneously. The investment doesn't just pay for itself. It compounds."

### Downsell Option: DIY Tier
- **Video modules + install guides + pre-developed agents** (price TBD)
- For people who are technical enough to implement on their own and don't need the custom build or founder access
- Serves as top-of-funnel for the full program

### Upsell Path
- **Monthly Advisory:** $2,000-$3,000/month for ongoing optimization, new system builds, and strategic consulting after the initial 6-month support period
- **DFY Client Projects:** If AI Drivers members want specific systems built for their own clients, those can be scoped as project work
- **Advanced Custom Builds:** Vertical-specific agent configurations and enterprise-grade automations beyond the initial build scope

## Why This vs. Alternatives

### 1. Do Nothing
Keep running your business the way you're running it now. Keep hiring when you need more capacity. Keep watching your margins shrink as payroll grows. Keep hearing about AI-powered businesses running lean while you run tired. Every month you wait, the operators who moved first pull further ahead.

### 2. DIY (Figure It Out Yourself)
Watch 200 YouTube videos. Buy 5 Gumroad templates. Spend 6 months stitching together a Frankenstein system from scattered tutorials. End up with disconnected tools that don't talk to each other and agents that aren't trained on your actual business. This is the path most people take. It's why most people end up with an expensive chatbot instead of a functioning system.

### 3. Hire a Developer
$15K-$50K+ to hire someone who understands AI infrastructure but has never run a business. They build you something technically impressive that doesn't map to how you actually make money. The system works in a demo. It fails in production. Because the person who built it doesn't understand business operations, client delivery, or revenue generation.

### 4. Buy a Course
$500-$2,000 for videos you'll watch 30% of. Generic frameworks that work "in theory." Nobody builds anything for you. Nobody trains agents on your business. Nobody is available when things break. You leave the course knowing more but having built nothing.

### 5. Join a Competitor Program
Most "AI business" programs are run by people who teach AI but don't run businesses on it. They sell frameworks they don't use. They show case studies from a previous business model, not from AI-powered operations. Ask them to show you their own system in production. Ask them to show you their own revenue generated through AI systems. Notice the silence.

**AI Drivers is different because:**
- The system you're getting is the system both founders use to run their businesses
- You get it built and installed in less than 5 days (not 8 weeks of curriculum)
- Both founders are directly accessible for 6 months (not a community moderator)
- $3M+ and $1M in revenue between both founders, all generated through AI-powered systems
- Every agent we build for any project, you get access to. Forever.

---

## USP Statement

**The only program where two operators who have collectively generated $4M+ through AI-powered systems will assess your business, custom-build your AI system team, install it in less than 5 days, and give you direct private access to both founders for 6 months. Not theory. Not templates. A custom build from people who run their businesses this way every single day.**

No competitor can say this because:
1. Course sellers don't build custom systems for you
2. Developers who build AI systems don't understand business operations
3. Business coaches teaching AI don't run their own businesses on AI systems
4. Nobody else offers the speed (less than 5 days to install) combined with the depth (6 months of founder access)
5. Nobody else gives you lifetime access to every agent they ever build
