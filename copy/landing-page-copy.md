## Section 2: The Problem

**Section Label:**
THE PROBLEM

**Headline:**
Everyone says AI agencies are the future. Nobody shows you how to actually build one.

**Body:**

You've seen the headlines.

Y Combinator just made AI-powered agencies a formal investment category. Their CEO says this batch is the most profitable in history. Anthropic's CEO predicts a one-person billion-dollar company by 2026. The narrative is everywhere.

And you're sitting there thinking: okay, but HOW?

You've tried ChatGPT. Maybe you bought a template. Maybe you watched 50 YouTube videos. You've played with prompts, tested tools, read threads. You know AI can do more than what you're getting out of it.

But you still don't have a system.

You're still doing most things manually. You're still limited by hours in the day. You're still watching technical founders on Twitter build million-dollar companies with 3 people while you grind through deliverables one at a time.

**Pain Bullets:**

- You have the skills but not the infrastructure. You know your craft. You just don't have a system that multiplies your output.
- You're buying tools but not connecting them. Subscriptions stack up. Workflows don't.
- You're watching the window close. Every month you wait, more people figure this out. The early advantage shrinks.
- You want to take on more clients but can't. Your bottleneck isn't demand. It's capacity.
- The "AI agency" content online is surface-level. Prompt lists. ChatGPT tutorials. Nothing that shows you how to build an actual operating system.

## Section 3: The Narrative Bridge

**Section Label:**
THE OPPORTUNITY

**Headline:**
The smartest investors in the world just validated this model. But they built no pathway for the rest of us.

**Body:**

Here's what's happening right now:

Y Combinator's Spring 2026 Request for Startups includes "AI-Powered Agencies" as a formal category. Their thesis: agencies of the future will look like software companies, with software margins. One person doing the work of ten. Tiny teams generating millions.

But Y Combinator invests $500K per company and takes equity. They accept 200 founders per batch out of tens of thousands of applicants. And their narrative assumes you're a technical founder who can code.

If you're a marketer, consultant, or agency operator with domain expertise but not a computer science degree, their pathway doesn't exist for you.

The demand is real. The opportunity is validated. The gap is implementation.

That's what AI Drivers is.

## Section 4: The Solution

**Section Label:**
AI DRIVERS

**Headline:**
Your agency. AI-powered. Fully operational in 30 days.

**Body:**

AI Drivers is a done-with-you, done-for-you hybrid that takes you from "I know AI can do more" to "I have a production system running my agency."

We don't hand you a course and wish you luck. We install the system, configure it for your business, and consult with you 1-on-1 until it's operational.

**4 Pillars (card grid):**

**Pillar 1: The System**
A production-grade AI operating system. Not prompts. Not templates. A multi-layer architecture with specialized agents, structured workflows, quality controls, and memory systems. The same system currently running multiple live client engagements.

**Pillar 2: The Setup**
Done-for-you environment configuration. We build your workspace, install your agents, configure your commands, and set up your quality gates. You're operational on day one. No technical skills required.

**Pillar 3: The Strategy**
1-on-1 consulting covering two critical angles. First: building the internal systems for your own agency, so you can take on more clients, produce faster, and charge more. Second: deploying AI into your clients' businesses, so you deliver better results and increase the value of every engagement.

**Pillar 4: The Support**
A private channel directly with me. Not a group chat. Not a community forum. A direct line for questions, feedback, work review, and troubleshooting. For the duration of your engagement and beyond.

## Section 5: Credibility / Founder

**Section Label:**
WHO'S BEHIND THIS

**Headline:**
Built by an operator. Not a theorist.

**Body:**

I'm Kabrin.

I run Crafted Marketing, a high-ticket agency that uses AI for everything. Research. Copywriting. Funnels. Email sequences. Landing pages. Client delivery. The full stack.

The system you get through AI Drivers is not something I built to sell you. It's what I built to run my agency. It powers every client engagement, every deliverable, every campaign. Then I realized: the system itself is the product.

I'm not an influencer teaching you what I read in a book. I'm an operator showing you what's running in production right now.

**[Photo placeholder: Kabrin headshot or workspace shot]**

**Proof Points (metric cards):**

- 4 active client engagements running simultaneously on the system
- 15+ deliverables produced for a single client launch in one session
- Full websites designed, built, and deployed in a single afternoon
- Complete launch campaigns (webinar scripts, email sequences, sales pages, social content) built end-to-end with the system

**Closing line:**
The page you're reading right now was built using the same system you'd be getting.

## Section 8: Qualification

**Section Label:**
IS THIS FOR YOU?

**Left Column: "This is for you if..."**

- You run an agency, freelance practice, or consulting business and want to multiply your output without multiplying your headcount
- You have domain expertise (marketing, sales, design, consulting, ops) and want to build an AI-powered agency
- You're tired of scattered tools and disconnected workflows that don't add up to a system
- You understand that AI is a force multiplier, not a magic button, and you're ready to put in the work to set it up right
- You want 1-on-1 guidance from someone who runs this model, not a group course with 500 other students

**Right Column: "This is NOT for you if..."**

- You're looking for passive income or a "push button money machine." This is an operating system. You operate it.
- You don't have a service, skill, or business idea. We build infrastructure for your agency. You need to know what your agency does.
- You won't commit 5-10 hours per week to implementation. The system works, but you have to show up.
- You want ChatGPT prompts. This is a multi-layer architecture with agents, quality control, and automation. Different category entirely.
- You expect results without effort. The consulting accelerates your timeline, but you still do the work.

## Section 9: FAQ

**Section Label:**
QUESTIONS

**Headline:**
Straight answers.

**Q: Is this just ChatGPT prompts?**
No. This is a production system with specialized agents, structured workflows, quality controls, and memory that maintains context across sessions. ChatGPT prompts are like having a notepad. This is like having an operating system. Different category.

**Q: Do I need technical skills or coding experience?**
No. The done-for-you setup handles all the technical configuration. You need to know your business and your craft. The system is built for operators, not developers.

**Q: How fast will I see results?**
The system is operational from day one after setup. Most people start producing client-level output within the first week. The full 30-day consulting period is about optimizing the system for your specific workflows and business strategy. By day 30, you should be running at 3-5x your previous speed.

**Q: What if my niche is different from your client examples?**
The consulting phase covers customization. We build 3-5 custom skills specifically for your vertical. The underlying system is architecture, not templates. It adapts to any service-based business.

**Q: Why $8,000?**
Because the system saves you hundreds of hours per year and enables you to serve more clients at higher quality. If you close one additional client at $3,000, you've recovered more than a third of the cost. Two clients and you're in profit. The ROI compounds every month.

**Q: What do I need to get started?**
A Claude Pro or Claude Team subscription (~$20-100/month), a computer with Claude Code installed (we help with this), and a clear idea of what your agency does or will do.

**Q: What happens after the 30 days?**
You keep the entire system, all updates, and private channel access. If you want ongoing strategic consulting, we offer a monthly advisory option. But the system is yours. It doesn't expire and there's no recurring fee for the core product.

## Section 10: Final CTA

**Headline:**
You've heard the thesis. Here's the implementation.

**Body:**

AI-powered agencies are not a prediction anymore. They're a category. The investors, the founders, and the operators who move first are going to define this space.

The system exists. It's running right now. It built the page you're reading.

The question is whether you want to keep hearing about it or start running it.

**CTA Button:**
Apply Now

**Friction reducers (below CTA):**
- Limited to [X] spots per month. 1-on-1 attention means this is not scalable beyond that.
- No commitment to apply. It's a conversation to see if this is the right fit.
- The system is the same one running live client engagements today. This is not a beta.

**Guarantee line:**
If you complete the full consulting process and don't see measurable improvement in your operational capacity, we continue working with you at no additional cost until you do.
