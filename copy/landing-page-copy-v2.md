## Section 2: The Problem

**Section Label:**
THE PROBLEM

**Headline:**
Everyone says AI is the future of business. Nobody actually installs it for you.

**Body:**

You've seen the headlines.

Y Combinator made AI-powered agencies a formal investment category. Their CEO says this batch is the most profitable in history. Anthropic's CEO predicts a one-person billion-dollar company by 2026.

And you're sitting there with a real business, real clients, real revenue. Thinking: okay, but HOW does this actually plug into what I do every day?

You've tried ChatGPT. Maybe you bought a course. Maybe you spent a weekend watching YouTube tutorials and ended up with a folder full of prompts that don't connect to anything.

But nothing changed.

You're still doing the same work the same way. Still limited by hours in the day. Still watching people with half your expertise scale past you because they figured out the systems part.

**Pain Bullets:**

- You have the skills. You don't have the infrastructure. Your expertise is real. Your output is capped by how fast you can personally produce.
- You're paying for tools that don't talk to each other. Subscriptions stack up. Workflows don't.
- You keep starting over. Every new AI tool means another learning curve, another half-built system, another abandoned experiment.
- You watch technical founders on Twitter build million-dollar operations with 3 people while you grind through deliverables one at a time.
- The "AI for business" content online is surface-level. Prompt lists. ChatGPT screenshots. Nothing that shows you how to build an actual operating system for YOUR business.

## Section 3: The Narrative Bridge

**Section Label:**
THE OPPORTUNITY

**Headline:**
The smartest investors in the world validated this model. Nobody built the implementation for the rest of us.

**Body:**

Here's what's happening right now.

Y Combinator's latest Request for Startups includes "AI-Powered Agencies" as a formal category. Their thesis: businesses of the future will look like software companies, with software margins. Tiny teams generating millions.

But Y Combinator invests $500K per company and takes equity. They accept 200 founders per batch out of tens of thousands of applicants. And their model assumes you're a technical founder who can code.

If you're a business owner, consultant, or operator with real domain expertise but not a computer science degree, their pathway doesn't exist for you.

The demand is real. The opportunity is validated by the best investors on the planet.

The gap is implementation.

That's what AI Drivers is. We took the thesis and built the bridge.

---

## Section 4: The Solution

**Section Label:**
HOW IT WORKS

**Headline:**
Your business. AI-powered. Fully operational in less than 5 days.

**Body:**

AI Drivers is not a course. Not a prompt library. Not a community where you figure it out on your own.

We assess your business, build a custom AI system trained on your specific operations, install it for you, and then stay in your corner for 6 full months to make sure it works.

You don't need to be technical. You don't need to learn to code. You need to show up with a business and let us build the engine.

**4 Pillars (card grid):**

**Pillar 1: Assess**
We map your business operations, identify the highest-value automation opportunities, and design a system architecture built specifically for how you work. Not a generic template. A blueprint for your business.

**Pillar 2: Build**
We build your custom AI system. Agents trained on your business, structured workflows matching your operations, quality controls tuned to your standards. This is a production system, not a demo.

**Pillar 3: Install**
Done-for-you implementation. We configure your workspace, deploy your agents, set up your automation, and test everything end-to-end. You're operational in less than 5 days. No technical skills required.

**Pillar 4: Support**
6 months of direct access to both founders through a private channel. 2x weekly coaching calls. Hands-on troubleshooting. We don't hand you a system and disappear. We stay until you've gotten your money back and then some.

## Section 5: Founders

**Section Label:**
ABOUT US

**Headline:**
Built by operators. Not theorists.

**Body:**

Most people selling "AI for business" have never run a business that depends on AI. They teach frameworks they read about. They sell courses about things they haven't done.

We built AI Drivers because we needed it for ourselves first. Then we realized: the system is the product.

**Founder Card 1:**

**Kabrin Johal** | Co-Founder

Started in fitness. Opened and operated 11 Orange Theory Fitness franchise locations. Opened them, operated them, exited all of them in 2020.

Went online. Tried dropshipping. Didn't work. Pivoted to high-ticket dropshipping. That worked. Sold to a major Vegas hotel chain.

April 2024: Launched Crafted Marketing, a high-ticket agency in the information product space. Built the entire fulfillment engine on AI. Every deliverable, every campaign, every client engagement. All completed through AI systems.

$3M+ in total revenue generated collectively from marketing, sales, and operations systems.

**[Photo placeholder: Kabrin headshot]**

---

**Founder Card 2:**

**Elijah Bricker** | Co-Founder (21)

Skipped college at 18. Started as a commercial realtor placing out-of-state investors into properties.

Hit a ceiling. Time was the bottleneck. Created Arbory LLC, a marketing agency, in 2025.

Generated $1M in revenue for business owners in 14 months.

Hit another ceiling. Went all-in on systems automation with Claude Code and OpenClaw. Built a closed-loop automated business where the systems handle the execution.

**[Photo placeholder: Elijah headshot]**

---

**Combined credibility block:**

- $4M+ combined revenue generated across marketing, sales, and operations
- 11 franchise locations opened and operated
- Closed-loop automated businesses (both of them)
- Every system we sell is a system we run

**Closing line:**
The page you're reading right now was built with the same system you'd be getting.

## Section 6: System Proof

**Section Label:**
THE SYSTEM

**Headline:**
This is what it does. Not what we say it does.

**Body:**

We don't have 47 testimonials from students yet. We're not going to fake it. Here's what we do have: two businesses that run on this system every day, and the numbers to prove it works.

**Metric Cards:**

- **$4M+** combined revenue generated through businesses powered by these systems
- **11** franchise locations opened, operated, and exited using operational systems thinking
- **$1M** in revenue generated for clients in 14 months (Arbory LLC)
- **Less than 5 days** from assessment to fully operational AI system
- **2** businesses currently running closed-loop automated on this exact infrastructure

**What the system handles:**

- Client research and market analysis
- Copywriting and content production
- Sales page and funnel builds
- Email sequences and nurture campaigns
- Landing page design and deployment
- Client onboarding and delivery workflows
- Campaign management and execution calendars

**System credibility line:**
This is not a prototype. Both founders operate their primary businesses on this system. Crafted Marketing runs every client engagement through it. Arbory LLC runs its entire operation on it. When we say "built by operators," we mean the system was built under pressure, with real clients, real deadlines, and real money on the line.

"The average client we work with makes the $5,000 back within their first 90 days. If you close one additional client, take on one more project, or save 15+ hours per week on operations, the math handles itself. And the system doesn't expire."

## Section 8: Qualification

**Section Label:**
IS THIS FOR YOU?

**Left Column: "This is for you if..."**

- You run a business, agency, or consultancy and want to multiply your output without multiplying your headcount
- You have real domain expertise (marketing, sales, consulting, coaching, operations, e-commerce) and want AI systems built around it
- You're tired of buying tools that don't connect, watching tutorials that don't apply, and starting over every few months
- You're willing to invest 5 days for the install and show up for coaching calls after that
- You want direct access to two founders who run this system in their own businesses, not a pre-recorded course with a Facebook group

**Right Column: "This is NOT for you if..."**

- You're looking for passive income or a magic button. This is an operating system. You still run your business. The system multiplies your capacity.
- You don't have a business, service, or clear idea of what you'd build. We install infrastructure for a real operation. You need to know what yours is.
- You want ChatGPT prompts. This is a multi-layer architecture with specialized agents, structured workflows, quality controls, and automation. Different category.
- You're not willing to show up for calls and engage with the process. The system works. But you have to work it.
- You expect results in 24 hours without doing anything. The install takes less than 5 days. The ROI takes up to 90 days. That's the honest timeline.

## Section 9: FAQ

**Section Label:**
QUESTIONS

**Headline:**
Straight answers.

**Q: Why $5,000?**
Because we build a custom system for your business, install it in less than 5 days, and then coach you through 6 months of implementation. The system is designed to pay for itself within 90 days. One new client. One freed-up bottleneck. One workflow that used to take 3 days now taking 3 hours. The math is simple. If you can't see a path to making $5,000 back within 90 days using AI automation, this probably isn't for you yet.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
Less than 5 days from assessment to fully operational system. That's not aspirational. That's the timeline. We assess your business, build the system, and install it. You don't need to learn anything technical during that phase. The 6 months of coaching after that is where you learn to operate it, optimize it, and squeeze every dollar out of it.

**Q: What happens after the 6 months?**
You keep everything. The system, the agents, every update we've ever released. Your Lifetime Agent Access means you get every future build and improvement at no extra cost. If you want continued 1-on-1 coaching beyond 6 months, we offer an advisory option. But the system is yours forever.

**Q: Do I need technical skills?**
No. The entire install is done for you. You need to know your business and your craft. We handle the technical configuration. If you can use a computer and attend a video call, you have enough technical skill for this.

**Q: What if my niche is different from yours?**
The system is architecture, not templates. We've built systems for marketing agencies, trading educators, fitness brands, nutrition coaches, and e-commerce operators. The assessment phase is where we learn your business. The build phase is where we customize everything for it. If you sell a service or product and have operations that could be faster, this works.

**Q: What's the ROI guarantee?**
We promise your investment back within 90 days. That means the system should generate or save you at least $5,000 in that window through new revenue, saved time, increased capacity, or all three. If you show up for calls, implement what we build, and engage with the process, the 90-day timeline is conservative.

**Q: What do I need to get started?**
A business (or a clear plan for one), a computer, and a Claude Pro or Claude Team subscription (roughly $20 to $100/month depending on the plan). We handle the rest during the install phase.

## Section 10: Final CTA

**Headline:**
Your investment back in 90 days. Or you shouldn't do this.

**Body:**

Here's what we believe: if this system can't pay for itself within 90 days, we have no business selling it.

That's not marketing language. That's how we actually feel about it. Both of us run our businesses on this system. Kabrin runs every client engagement through it. Elijah runs his entire operation on it. It works because we built it under real conditions, with real pressure, for real results.

The question isn't whether AI is going to change how businesses operate. That's settled. The question is whether you're going to keep watching from the sidelines or let two people who've already built this install it in your business this week.

Less than 5 days to operational.
6 months of direct support.
$5,000.

**CTA Button:**
Apply Now

**Friction reducers (below CTA):**
- Limited spots. Every system is custom-built. We don't batch this.
- No commitment to apply. The application is a conversation to see if this is the right fit for your business.
- Both founders on every call. You're not getting passed to an assistant.

**Guarantee line:**
ROI back within 90 days. That's the promise. Show up, implement, and engage with the coaching. The system handles the rest.
