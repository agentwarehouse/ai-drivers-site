# Offer: AI Drivers

## The Headline (Single-Sentence Offer)

**We build your AI-powered agency in 30 days. The complete operating system, done-for-you setup, and 1-on-1 consulting from an operator running this exact model right now.**

Alternative headlines (for testing):
- "Get the exact operating system behind a working AI agency. Built, configured, and customized for your business in 30 days."
- "We install a production AI system into your agency and show you how to 3x your output without hiring. Done-for-you setup. 1-on-1 strategy. 30 days."
- "Stop learning about AI agencies. Start running one. Full system install + strategic consulting. 30 days to operational."

---

## Offer Classification

- **Type:** Demand Generation (people are not searching for "AI agency operating system." We interrupt with the narrative, sell the concept first, then sell the implementation.)
- **Delivery Model:** Hybrid (DWY consulting + DFY system setup)
- **Logistical Intensity Level:** High (we do the system build, environment setup, and strategic consulting. Client participates in strategy sessions and implementation.)

---

## The Promise (Transformation)

- **Before State:** You keep hearing "AI agencies are the future." You've maybe tried ChatGPT, maybe bought a $47 template, maybe watched 50 YouTube videos. But you still don't have a system. You're still doing everything manually. You're either stuck at your current revenue, burning out trying to scale, or sitting on domain expertise with no idea how to package it into an AI-powered agency. You see technical founders on Twitter building million-dollar companies with 3 people, and you feel like you missed the window.

- **After State:** You have a fully operational AI system installed and configured for your specific business. You can produce client deliverables in hours that used to take days. Your research, copywriting, funnels, emails, and client delivery run through a structured system with built-in quality control. You have a clear consulting plan for both your own agency growth AND for deploying AI into your clients' businesses. You're not wondering "how do I use AI?" You're operating it daily, taking on more work, charging more, and keeping more.

- **Timeframe:** 30 days to fully operational
- **Mechanism:** The AI Drivers operating system (production-grade agent architecture used in a running agency) + done-for-you environment setup + 1-on-1 strategic consulting covering both internal operations and client-facing delivery

---

## Who This Is For

- **Agency owners** (marketing, design, dev, consulting) doing $5K-$50K/month who want to multiply output without multiplying headcount
- **Freelancers and consultants** with domain expertise who want to productize their knowledge and scale with AI
- **Aspiring agency founders** with skills in marketing, sales, operations, or a specific vertical who want to build an AI-powered agency from scratch
- **Operators inside Artisan Lab** who are already building and want the infrastructure to match their ambition
- **People who are tired of prompts and want a system.** You've seen the YouTube tutorials. You've played with ChatGPT. You know AI can do more. You just need someone to install the engine, not hand you another manual.

---

## Who This Is NOT For

- **People looking for passive income or a "push button" solution.** This is an operating system, not a lottery ticket. You will need to operate it.
- **People who don't have a service, skill, or business idea.** We build the infrastructure for your agency. You need to know what your agency does.
- **People who won't commit 5-10 hours per week to implementation.** The system works, but it requires your input during the consulting phase.
- **People who are not willing to invest in Claude Pro or Claude Team.** The system runs on Claude. That's a separate cost (~$20-100/month depending on plan).
- **People just looking for ChatGPT prompts.** This is a multi-layer architecture with agents, skills, SOPs, automation, and quality control. If you want a list of prompts, this is not for you.

## The Guarantee

**Implementation Guarantee:** If you complete the full 30-day consulting process, implement the system as directed, and don't see a measurable improvement in your operational capacity (speed of deliverable production, number of clients you can serve, or quality of output), we will continue working with you at no additional cost until you do.

This is not a money-back guarantee. This is a "we don't stop until it works" guarantee. Because the system works. We use it every day. The variable is implementation, and that's exactly what the consulting covers.

### Stipulations

**State Stipulations (what you must already have):**
1. An active business, agency, or clear plan for one (you need something to apply the system to)
2. A Claude Pro or Claude Team subscription (the system runs on Claude)
3. A computer with Claude Code installed (we help with setup if needed)

**Action Stipulations (what you must do):**
4. Complete all scheduled consulting sessions (minimum 4 over 30 days)
5. Dedicate a minimum of 5 hours per week to implementation during the 30-day period
6. Implement at least 3 core workflows into active client work or business operations
7. Provide access to review at least one active client project or business process for consulting purposes

### Refund Structure

No refunds for non-participation. If you complete all stipulations and the system demonstrably fails to improve your operational capacity, we extend the consulting at no cost until it does. Based on 4 live client deployments of this system, the expected improvement in deliverable production speed is 3-5x within 30 days.

## Pricing

### Standard Pricing
- **Full Investment:** $8,000
- **Payment Plan:** 2 x $4,250 (30 days apart)

### Artisan Lab Pricing (V1 Pilot)
- **Full Investment:** $4,000
- **Payment Plan:** 2 x $2,125 (30 days apart)

### ROI Math
"If you use the system to close just ONE additional client at $3,000, you've made back 75% of your investment. The system is designed to help you serve more clients at higher quality, meaning the ROI compounds every month. Two additional clients = paid in full. Five additional clients = 3.75x return. And the system doesn't expire."

"The question isn't whether $4,000 is a lot. The question is: what's it costing you every month to NOT have a system? If you're spending 20 hours a week on work that could take 5 hours with the right infrastructure, that's 60+ hours per month. At any billing rate, the math is obvious."

### Upsell Path
- **Monthly Advisory:** $2,000-$3,000/month for ongoing optimization, new skill builds, and strategic consulting after the initial 30-day engagement
- **DFY Client Projects:** If AI Drivers members want specific deliverables built for their clients (landing pages, funnels, campaigns), those can be scoped as project work at Crafted Marketing rates
- **Advanced Skill Builds:** Custom vertical-specific skills and agent configurations beyond the initial 3-5 included

### Downsell Option
- **System Only (no consulting):** $1,997. You get the full operating system, the environment setup guide (self-install), and community access. No 1-on-1 consulting, no private channel, no custom skills. For people who are technical enough to implement on their own.

### Cross-Sell
- **Client Acquisition System:** If they need help getting clients (not just serving them), the Dream 100 outreach system and content marketing engine can be packaged separately or added to the consulting scope.

## Why This vs. Alternatives

### 1. Do Nothing
Keep hearing "AI agencies are the future" without acting on it. Watch technical founders with less domain expertise than you build agencies using AI while you continue doing everything manually. Every month you wait, the window shrinks and the competition grows.

### 2. DIY (Figure It Out Yourself)
Watch 200 YouTube videos. Buy 5 different Gumroad templates. Spend 6 months stitching together a Frankenstein system from scattered tutorials. End up with a collection of disconnected prompts, not an operating system. This is the path 95% of people take, and it's why 95% of people never build a functioning AI agency.

### 3. Hire a Developer
$10K-$50K+ to hire someone who understands AI but doesn't understand marketing, sales, client delivery, or agency operations. They build you a technically impressive system that doesn't map to how agencies actually make money. You end up with a solution looking for a problem.

### 4. Buy a Course
$497-$2,000 for videos you'll watch 30% of. Generic frameworks that work "in theory." No 1-on-1 support, no custom implementation, no done-for-you setup. You leave the course knowing more but having built nothing.

### 5. Join a Competitor Program
Most "AI agency" programs are run by people who teach about AI agencies but don't run one. They sell frameworks they don't use. They show you prompts, not systems. They reference case studies from their previous business model, not from AI agency clients. Notice that.

**AI Drivers is different because the system you're getting is the system we use.** Every skill, every agent, every workflow. It's in production. It's building client campaigns, deploying landing pages, writing sales copy, and managing multi-channel launches right now. You're not getting a course. You're getting an install.

---

## USP Statement

**The only offer in the market that gives you a production AI operating system from a live, running agency, done-for-you installation, AND strategic consulting for both your internal operations and your client delivery. Not theory. Not prompts. A working system from someone who uses it to run a real agency every day.**

No competitor can say this because:
1. Course sellers don't run agencies
2. Agency owners don't package their systems for sale
3. AI tool builders don't understand agency operations
4. Nobody else offers the DFY setup + DWY consulting hybrid at this price point
