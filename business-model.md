# AI Drivers - Business Model Architecture

**Brand:** AI Drivers
**Founder:** Kabrin Johal (Crafted Marketing)
**Date:** February 19, 2026
**Positioning:** The operational system for building and scaling AI-powered agencies

---

## THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY

Y Combinator just made "AI-Powered Agencies" a formal investment category. Garry Tan says his latest batch is the most profitable in YC history. Dario Amodei predicts a one-person billion-dollar company by 2026. The narrative is everywhere.

But here's what nobody is addressing:

- **YC serves the 1%.** They fund 200 companies per batch out of tens of thousands of applicants. Everyone else hearing this narrative has zero pathway.
- **The narrative assumes technical founders.** Marketers, consultants, freelancers, and existing agency owners are completely unserved.
- **Nobody teaches the HOW.** YC publishes the thesis. Nobody sells the implementation.
- **Client acquisition is ignored.** The entire YC conversation is about AI for delivery. Nobody talks about AI for getting and keeping clients.

**The gap:** Thousands of people hear "AI agencies are the future" every week. They have no way to act on it. AI Drivers fills that gap.

---

## WHY YOU (AND ONLY YOU)

Most people talking about "AI agencies" are:
- Developers who have never sold a client
- Info marketers who have never built an AI system
- Consultants selling frameworks they don't use

You are the rare overlap:
1. **You actually run a high-ticket AI agency.** Crafted Marketing serves real clients at $2K+/month.
2. **You built a working AI operating system.** The 3-layer architecture (35 skills, 92 SOPs, custom agents, automation hooks) is not theory. It is running in production right now.
3. **You have case studies.** AJ Does Trading (15+ deliverables, $3,500 product launch), Club 16 (14 deliverables, done-with-you consulting), ALO (full web3 site deployed), SNS Nutrition (landing page + Stripe checkout).
4. **You understand direct response.** Funnels, copy, conversion, client acquisition. The stuff that actually makes agencies money.
5. **You don't need VC money.** Your model is cash-flow profitable on day one. You teach the realistic version, not the venture fantasy.

This is the positioning: **"Built by an operator, not a theorist."**

## THE THREE TIERS

### Overview

| Tier | Model | Who It Serves | Price Range | Revenue Type |
|------|-------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Tier 3: DFY** | Done-For-You Agency | Businesses wanting AI systems built | $10K-$50K+ | Project / retainer |
| **Tier 2: DWY** | Done-With-You Consulting | Agency owners + aspiring solo operators | $5K-$10K program / $3K-$5K/mo | Program / recurring |
| **Tier 1: DIY** | Self-Serve Products | Bootstrappers, freelancers, learners | $297-$1,997 | One-time + upsell |

The tiers work as a **value ladder** and a **filtering mechanism.** Each tier feeds the others.

### The Flywheel

1. **Content creates awareness.** You publish content riding the YC "AI agency" narrative. You're not competing with YC. You're saying "YC is right. Here's how to actually do it."
2. **DIY products create buyers.** Low friction, low risk. People buy a $97-$497 product and get immediate value.
3. **Buyers become students.** 5-10% of DIY buyers upgrade to the DWY Accelerator.
4. **Students become referrers.** DWY graduates know businesses that need DFY work. They refer them to you.
5. **DFY clients become case studies.** Every DFY engagement produces proof that feeds back into content.
6. **Repeat.** Each cycle adds more proof, more content, more buyers.

| Tier | Volume | Avg Price | Monthly Revenue |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| DIY Products | 30 sales | $400 avg | $12,000 |

| DFY Clients | 2 active | $15,000 avg | $30,000 |
| **Total** | | | **$58,667/mo** |

---

## GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Seed (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal:** Establish the brand and capture early demand

1. **Launch AI Drivers website** - Single page with brand positioning, email capture, and "coming soon" for products
2. **Start content on X/Twitter** - 2-3 posts/day riding the YC AI agency narrative. Position yourself as the practitioner, not the theorist.
3. **Create the lead magnet** - "The 1-Person AI Agency Blueprint" (free PDF or mini-course). Captures emails. Introduces the 3-layer architecture.
4. **Build in public** - Show your actual AI workflows. Screenshot your Claude Code sessions. Show before/after of client work. This is your proof.

### Phase 2: Product (Weeks 5-8)
**Goal:** Launch DIY products and start generating revenue

1. **Launch the AI Drivers Vault** - Start with 3-5 individual skills + the Agency Starter Pack bundle
2. **Launch the community** - Discord or Slack for all buyers
3. **YouTube content** - Weekly videos: "How I Built [X] for a Client Using AI" or "Recreating [Agency Service] with AI Agents"
4. **Start collecting DWY interest** - Waitlist for the Accelerator program

### Phase 3: Program (Weeks 9-16)
**Goal:** Launch DWY and start building recurring revenue

1. **Open Accelerator applications** - Sell the first cohort (target 10 people at $5K)
2. **Run Cohort 1** - 8 weeks, document everything, collect testimonials
3. **Continue DIY sales** - Let organic content and community drive ongoing product sales
4. **Start DFY conversations** - By now, inbound interest from businesses who saw your content

### Phase 4: Scale (Months 5+)
**Goal:** All three tiers running, focus on optimization

1. **Evergreen the Accelerator** - Rolling enrollment instead of cohort-based (or keep cohorts for urgency)
2. **Expand DIY catalog** - New skills, new bundles, based on community demand
3. **Systematize DFY delivery** - Build proposal templates, audit frameworks, repeatable processes
4. **Add team if needed** - 1-2 people for DFY delivery support (using your own AI system, obviously)

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### What YC Says vs. What AI Drivers Says

| YC | AI Drivers |
|----|-----------|
| "AI agencies are the future" | "Here's exactly how to build one this month" |
| Targets technical founders | Targets marketers, consultants, and existing agencies |
| Invests $500K for equity | Sells products, programs, and services for cash |
| Serves the top 1% | Serves the 99% who don't get into YC |
| Theory + thesis | Systems + implementation |
| Venture-scale outcomes | Cash-flow-scale outcomes |

### Against Other "AI Agency" Educators
Most people teaching about AI agencies are:
- Showing ChatGPT prompts (surface-level, no system)
- Selling $47 Gumroad templates (no depth, no support)
- Teaching theory without running an agency themselves

**AI Drivers' edge:** You sell the actual operating system you use every day. The skills, agents, and workflows are not hypothetical. They are production systems running client work right now.

---

## BRAND POSITIONING NOTES

**AI Drivers** works on multiple levels:
- You "drive" AI to produce results (operator positioning)
- You're in the "driver's seat" (control, not just prompting)
- "Drivers" implies a team/community of operators (plural, movement-building)
- Clean, modern, non-techy feel (not "AI Agency Academy" or "Prompt Engineer Pro")

**Tagline options:**
- "Build. Drive. Scale."
- "The operating system for AI-powered agencies"
- "AI agencies for the rest of us"
- "Stop prompting. Start operating."

**Brand voice:** Direct, operational, proof-driven. Zero hype. Show the system, show the results, let people draw their own conclusions. The opposite of the "AI will change everything!!" crowd.

---

## WHAT TO BUILD FIRST

**Priority 1 (This week):**
1. AI Drivers landing page with email capture
2. Lead magnet: "The 1-Person AI Agency Blueprint"
3. First 3-5 X/Twitter posts establishing the positioning

**Priority 2 (Next 2 weeks):**
4. Package 3-5 skills as sellable DIY products
5. Set up checkout (Whop or Gumroad)
6. Launch the AI Drivers Vault with initial products

**Priority 3 (Week 4-6):**
7. DWY Accelerator curriculum finalized
8. Sales page or VSL for the Accelerator
9. Open applications for Cohort 1

Everything else builds on top of these foundations.
